# planner

This day planner will help keep track of daily tasks during your normal work day (8am to 5pm)

When the site loads it will populate the hours, text fields and save buttons. It will also load any saved tasks you had from the day prior.

You may add/change your tasks and click the save button to add that task to the local storage.

To start a new day click the reset button at the bottom of the form.

As the day progresses the background color of the text fields will change from green (future hour) to red(current hour) to grey (past hour)
